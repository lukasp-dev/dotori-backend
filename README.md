## Why Dotori?

Navigating college admissionsâ€”especially abroadâ€”can be stressful, confusing, and far too expensive.
Agencies charge steep fees for services as simple as essay review, leaving many students without affordable guidance.

**Dotori changes this.**
We provide **24/7 AI-powered essay feedback**, **resume-driven prompts**, and a **final human review**, all at a fair price.
Built by students, for studentsâ€”because your story deserves to be written, not priced.
